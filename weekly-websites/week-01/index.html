      <p style="font-size: 20px">What I Found Interesting:</p>

      <p>
        I was very interested some of the elements that this website incorporated. One being the way the that you could see a brief part of almost every section of the website just by scrolling down. Another, was the way the picture of the goggles and different aspects of it changed as you scrolled down the page, revealing its different features. However, I would have liked it more if the different aspects of the picture came up when the curser is placed over top of the circles. The last thing that interested me, which is shown in the bottom portion that said THE MOVIES WATCH EM, was when you hovered your curser over the MOVIES drawing it split in half and a drawing of an old film camera popped up.
