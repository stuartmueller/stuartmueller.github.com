      <p style="font-size: 20px">What I Found Interesting:</p>

      <p>
      I liked the design of the background. The way more lines came in as you scrolled down makes you want to continue scrolling to the bottom. Different designs are made the further you scroll down, which makes it even more intriguing. Another aspect that is interesting was how they give you the option to change the color of the background and lines.
