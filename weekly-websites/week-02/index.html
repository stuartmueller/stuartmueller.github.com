      <p style="font-size: 20px">What I Found Interesting:</p>

      <p>
        The bottom of the website really intrigued me. When you get to the bottom of the website there is an image that starts in parts, but when you continue to scroll the parts come together to make a full image. I also liked how the text, both on the top and bottom, look as if they were being written by hand when they first load the page.
